# 16.-Csharp-Learning-and-Unity-Prototype-2D-Game
My learning journey of the C# programming language and the Unity game development framework (via creating a prototype 2D game). 

Links sources when building the Unity game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t=1s (Intro to Unity)

C# is also an object oriented programming language, like Python.
