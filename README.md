My learning journey of the C# programming language and the Unity game development framework.

the C# environment is for VS code IDE, not sure if it works for other ides tho
learn code archives is coupled with it

Unity C# syntax Unity project is where you can run the C# codes in the Unity editor
Unity C# syntax leanr code archives comes with it

In order to set up the Unity project, refer to 19. 2D Unity Game, the section 'How to donwload and use a unity source code from gitihub in your unity editor/software'
