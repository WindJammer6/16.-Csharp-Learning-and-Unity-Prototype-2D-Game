After working with Python for quite a while, I wanted to adopt a second programming language to further hone my programming skills. In addition to this, a friend of mine (Github account: [WolfPark](https://github.com/wolfparktaerim)) always wanted to create a video game of his own, and recommended me one of the many powerful game development engines/framework, [Unity](https://unity.com/download). However, the main issue is that Unity uses the C# language, rather than Python. Hence, I decided to take this opportunity to while helping out on making a video game on Unity, to also learn the C# programming language, as well as some of the Unity C# syntax.

Apparently the C# programming language is also an object-oriented programming language, like Python.

Apart from the '[Unity C# Syntax learn code archives](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20learn%20code%20archives)' folder's sources where I learnt Unity C# syntax, I also made reference from this popular 'The Unity Tutorial For Complete Beginners' Youtube tutorial video (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t=1s (Game Maker's Toolkit)) to get a general grasp on how the Unity editor/software looks like and work, which helped tremondously in my understanding of the Unity editor/software.

An example of what this 'The Unity Tutorial For Complete Beginners' Unity Youtube tutorial video by Game Maker's Toolkit taught, on the terminology of the 4 most important panels of the Unity editor/software:

## [1. C# environment in VS code (to run C# code)](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20environment%20in%20VS%20code%20(to%20run%20C%23%20code)) <a name = "csharpenvironmentinvscode"></a> [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs)](https://skillicons.dev)

This is the C# environment that you need to set up in VS code in order to run your C# files in VS code. In this C# environment in VS code folder, you can modify the 'run_code_here.cs' C# file to whatever C# code you want to run in VS code. Don't modify anything else in this C# environment in VS code folder as it might introduce bugs to your C# environment in VS code.

This is Youtube video where I learnt how to set up this C# environment in VS code, and how to use it to run C# code in VS code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO4BGZOuUkM (Tech Decode Tutorials)

I'm not sure if this C# environment works for other IDE/compilers... I have only ever used it for VS code and it works for VS code.

## [2. C# learn code archives](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20learn%20code%20archives) <a name = "csharpcodearchives"></a> [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs)](https://skillicons.dev)
This folder contains all the C# files during my C# programming language learning journey, segregated into 4 folders, '[C# basics](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20learn%20code%20archives/1.%20C%23%20basics)', '[C# built-in data structures](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20learn%20code%20archives/2.%20C%23%20built-in%20data%20structures)', '[C# OOP](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20learn%20code%20archives/3.%20C%23%20OOP)' and '[C# short projects](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20learn%20code%20archives/4.%20C%23%20short%20projects)', organised based on the  programming concept of each C# file. Most of the information in the C# files in this folder is taken from this 3 hour long Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8&t=12271s (freeCodeCamp), while I split its lessons myself to the individual folders.

For the information in the C# files in the [C# basics](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20learn%20code%20archives/1.%20C%23%20basics) folder, '[920.

*How to use the C# files in this folder?*  
The C# files in this folder need to be used along with the '[C# environment in VS code (to run C# code)](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/C%23%20environment%20in%20VS%20code%20(to%20run%20C%23%20code))' folder in order to run them in VS code.

## [3. Unity C# Syntax learn Unity project](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/Unity%20C%23%20Syntax%20learn%20Unity%20project) <a name = "unitycsharpsyntaxlearnunityproject"></a> [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=unity)](https://skillicons.dev)
This is the Unity C# syntax learn project folder, which you can treat as the 'environment' to run the Unity C# scripts on the Unity editor/software, since these Unity C# scripts cannot be run on other IDEs, such as VS code, only in the Unity editor/software's terminal as a Unity project.

I did not refer to any sources in order to create this folder since the Unity editor/software automatically generates a Unity project folder like this one whenever you create a Unity game, which stores all the information of your Unity game, and allows you to run/edit your Unity game and the C# scripts inside it in the Unity editor/software when you import this Unity project folder into the Unity editor/software.

Refer to my seperate repository, [19.-2D-Unity-Game](https://github.com/WindJammer6/19.-2D-Unity-Game) to see what does each seperate folder within this '[Unity C# syntax learn project folder](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/Unity%20C%23%20Syntax%20learn%20Unity%20project)' does. And also, how to download this '[Unity C# syntax learn project folder](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/Unity%20C%23%20Syntax%20learn%20Unity%20project)' 'Unity project' (or any other Unity projects) from Github, as well as using it in the Unity editor/software's terminal, in the section 'How to download and use this Unity source code on Github in your Unity editor/software?' of the repository's 'README.md' file.

## [4. Unity C# Syntax learn code archives](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/Unity%20C%23%20Syntax%20learn%20code%20archives) <a name = "unitycsharpsyntaxlearncodearchives"></a> [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=unity)](https://skillicons.dev)
This folder contains all the C# files during my Unity C# syntax learning journey, organised roughly according to the order of the Unity's Youtube playlist's videos on Unity C# syntax. (link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0S9-X2Q021GUtolTqbUBB9B (Unity)) Most of the information in this folder is taken from this Unity Youtube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0S9-X2Q021GUtolTqbUBB9B (Unity), with a lot of assistance from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and Googling due to how poor Unity's Youtube videos tutorials on Unity C# syntax are at teaching haiz... I did skip some of the videos from the Unity Youtube playlist as well, did not follow all of them exactly.

*How to use the C# files in this folder?*  
The C# files in this folder needs to be used along with the '[Unity C# Syntax learn Unity project](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/Unity%20C%23%20Syntax%20learn%20Unity%20project)' folder in order to run them in the Unity editor/software's terminal, since these Unity C# scripts cannot be run on other IDEs, such as VS code. (which these C# files already are added to the [Unity C# Syntax learn Unity project](https://github.com/WindJammer6/16.-Csharp-and-Unity-Learning/tree/main/Unity%20C%23%20Syntax%20learn%20Unity%20project))
